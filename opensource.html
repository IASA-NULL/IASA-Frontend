                free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.</p>
            <p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they
                are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
                redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative
                works.</p>
